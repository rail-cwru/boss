    Complete rewrite, correction and optimization of agent-elimination function in CGS
        (23x speedup on 4ring, 2000-10000x speedup on 8-clique and 8-tree)

2019 01 25
    Optimizations to argmax with tiebreaks

2019 01 26
    Generalization of some optimized vector-math functions which used cached buffers
    Improved efficiency and readability of PredatorPrey observe method
    Bugfix of setting captured prey features to zero after sorting by distance (which was wrong)
    More than 2x speedup on observe.
    Predprey on greedy escape now learnable... after squaring the modified-distance values.
        It's probably got something to do with the nature of summation.

    Discovered discrepancy in predprey learning depending on reward scaling.
    Set up nicer interfacing for deletion experiment.
    Fixed bugs with calculating the wrong mean cumulative reward over evaluation.
