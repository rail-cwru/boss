What is Imeiro?
---------------
Imeiro is a modular and extensible reinforcement learning framework that supports competitive and cooperative Multiagent Reinforcement Learning on a variety of predefined environments with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents.

- Multiple environments with varying number of agents.
- Multiple policy/agent systems (e.g shared policy, independant policies)
- Multiple RL algorithms (e.g policy gradient, temporal difference)
- Controller and config system to easily run experiments with different properties.
- Callbacks to easily augment experiments in a recordable fashion
