    Made some changes to the base environment class. We changed how config an domain works, so figuring out how to
    incoporate that into the base environment class took some time.
    Began work in test_environment. I implemented most of the functionality, but it doesn't work with domain and properties yet
    We need to get more of the specifics worked out on that before i am able to implement it.
    Files modified: environment/base.py, environment/test_environment.py
