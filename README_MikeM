Week 9/28:*****************************************************************************************

Added base and skeleton classes for features in algorithms and policy. Discussed options with group. Also discussed coding styling and conventions and project setup (such as folder structure). Added in policy gaussian_exploration from old code and went over how some of it could be refactored, and how much would need to be refactored. Served as baseline for importing further policies.

Also spent a good amount of time watching reinforcment learning lectures to better inform algorithm structure. Lectures found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ.10/28:

Week 10/28:*****************************************************************************************
Reworked algorithm structure a bit and fleshed out the rest of the structure for all the algorithms that we will be implementing. 

Fleshed out more policy structure and added bases for major policies.

Watched more video lectures on reinforcment learninng

Coding time: 5 hours
Lecture time: 5 hours

Week 10/12:*****************************************************************************************
Reworked a bit of the structure of the algorithms module. Moved what was policy module to policy_sampler module. Made new module Policy which handels discrepencies between value based and action based methods. Implemented the fundamental code for some algorithms such as TemporalDifference, QLearning, and PolicyGradient. This algorithms will still need to handel corner cases but the 'mathmatical' part is there. Reviewed lectures a bit to help with new code structure.

Coding Time: 6 hours
Lecture time: 1 hour


Week 10/19:*****************************************************************************************
Polished up algorithm. Finished up policy samplers and polished up policy. Still need to add properties and documentation.

Coding Time: 5 hours
Lecture time: 2 hours

Week 10/26:*****************************************************************************************
Added eglibility trace/online version of temporal difference learning. Refactored code to reflect this change. Added config structure and set up the essential configuration parameters. Also watched lectures on exploration methods, some of which will be implemented in Policy next week as policy samplers. Refactored some of the existing algorithm structure.

Coding Time: 4 Hours
Lecture Time: 2 Hours

Week 11/2:*****************************************************************************************
Refactored algorithms a bit. Added a model class. Integrated model into algorithms (mostly). Added properties and config restrictions to classes. Added documentation. Fleshed out the init of a lot of classes.

Coding Time: 5 Hours 

Week 11/9:*********************************************************************
Got code integrated with other modules. Did major refactoring of policy gradient methods. Added tensorflow support. Did a large amount of debugging. Added more configs, properties, and documentation. Ran test environment. Reviewed more RL material

Coding Time: 17 hours
Lecture Time: 2 hours

Week 11/16:*********************************************************************
Debugged policy gradient a bit. Restructered a few things into interfaces such as TensorflowSampler and AttributableFA. Added some more functionaility to Temporal difference.

I didn't have time to get a lot done this week, which is why I worked ahead last week a la the syllabus.

Coding Time: 1 hour
Lecture Time: 1.5 hours

Week 11/30:*********************************************************************
Did so many things.... Finalized the tensorflow interface/wrapping. Polished up policy gradient. Got OnlineQ and OnlineSARSA working and added more to algorithm hierarchy. Setup models. Made algorithm stateless.

Coding Time: 25 hours

Week 12/07:*********************************************************************
The biggest thing was polishing up the Policy Sampler interface. This involved some refactoring, and making sure it could handel discrete and continuous action spaces. Documentation was also added, and some code was stylistically cleaned up. Also made sure all the config and properties aspects were working correctly. This included making some modifications to the config parser itself.

Coding Time: 10 hours
